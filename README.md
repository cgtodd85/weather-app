## Description

A weather dashboard with a 5 day forecast and more

## Usage

Enter the name of your city to get the current weather conditions and the 5 day forecast

## Development

There is plenty more to develop including a better CSS styling. My primary concern was understanding and implementing the effective javascript to retrieve the weather data.
